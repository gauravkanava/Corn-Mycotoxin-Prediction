## Project Title: Hyperspectral Imaging Analysis for Mycotoxin Prediction

### Overview

This project involves processing hyperspectral imaging data, performing dimensionality reduction, and developing a machine learning model to predict mycotoxin levels (DON concentration) in corn samples. It includes data cleaning, normalization, spectral visualization, PCA/t-SNE analysis, and predictive modeling using Random Forest or other ML techniques.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or later). It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Then, launch Jupyter Notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the provided `.ipynb` file and execute the cells in sequential order.

## Execution Steps

1. **Load the dataset:** The dataset (`TASK.csv`) should be placed inside the `data/` folder.
2. **Run preprocessing:** Execute the first few cells to check for missing values, outliers, and normalize spectral features.
3. **Visualize spectral bands:** Generate line plots and heatmaps to analyze spectral reflectance.
4. **Apply dimensionality reduction:** Use PCA to reduce feature dimensions and visualize variance contribution. Optionally, apply t-SNE for clustering insights.
5. **Train the model:** Choose a model (Random Forest or other machine learning models) and train it on the dataset.
6. **Optimize model:** Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
7. **Evaluate the model:** Compute regression metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ²) and visualize performance.
8. **Interpret results:** Plot actual vs. predicted values and discuss findings.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Experiment with CNNs or LSTMs for deep learning-based spectral analysis.
- Fine-tune PCA component selection to retain optimal variance.
- Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Utilize advanced hyperparameter tuning strategies.
- Consider deploying a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.
